Constitution
============

This doccument was submitted to the AUSC when we registered as an official student group. As such, this doc is a patchwork of text, parts written by us and parts inserted, because they are required by the administration.

The purpose of this text is to 

    1) As a reference to future MOBs, and other UC Berkeley student groups

    2) Propose a conversation about what an academy-independant constitution would look like

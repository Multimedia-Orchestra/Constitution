Constitution
============

This doccument was submitted to the AUSC when we registered as an official student group. As such, this doc is a bit of a patchwork of real stuff, sarcasm and 

parts that were written by us and parts that were inserted, because they are required by the administration.

The purpose of this text is to 

    1) As a reference to future MOBs, and other UC Berkeley student groups

    2) Allow members to easily propose changes to the constitution.

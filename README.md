Constitution
============

This doccument was submitted to the AUSC when we registered as an official student group. As such, this doc is a bit of a patchwork of real stuff, sarcasm and parts required to be included and verbatim by the administration.

The purpose of this text is to 

    1) As a reference to future MOBs, and other UC Berkeley student groups

    2) Allow members to easily propose changes to the constitution.

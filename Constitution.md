        and innovative technology.

#Article III - Membership

        Anyone is eligible for membership to the Multimedia Orchestra @Berkeley, regardless of campus affiliation. All members are free to participate in any group activity or meeting. Off-campus participants will be considered “associate” members. (Because…) Only currently registered students, faculty, and staff may be “active members” in a registered student organization. Only active members may vote or hold office. Otherwise, all members have identical status and rights within the group.

        We will not haze according to California State Law. 

        We will not restrict membership based upon race, color, national origin, religion, sex, physical and mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, age, sexual orientation, citizenship or status as a covered veteran (special disabled veteran, Vietnam-era veteran or any other veteran who served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized).

#Article IV - Officers & Elections

        The Multimedia Orchestra @Berkeley is a Holarchy. That is to say, each group, subgroup and member of the Multimedia Orchestra is a Holonic unit, which may be a member of and or interacting with other Holons or act independently. The organization is divided into many interacting sub-groups (or Holons). Each holon has a facilitator who guides the group’s activities and provides technical support. There may also be a central organizer who helps facilitate larger group meetings that including many sub-groups. All group titles (ie. Fearless Leader, Media Coordinator) are constructions used only for interactions with institutions outside of the group, which expect titled membership.

        The executive committee is made up of all members. Because there is no distinction between officers and members, there will be no elections, time constraints on officer service, or official process for officer removal. Derek Weinmuller serves as the primary signatory and “Fearless Leader.”

#Article V – Meetings

        Sub-groups of the Multimedia Orchestra will meet on an ad hoc basis to work on specific projects. In addition, there will be several organization-wide meetings or “Hack Days.” The, “Fearless Leader” calls these organizing-wide meetings. Quorum is one. If an additional or emergency meeting is needed in a sub-group or for the group as a whole, any member of the relevant group can call the meeting.
